# ESP8266 IoT room thermometer

Arduino/ESP8266 code for an Internet of Things (IoT) room thermometer.

More information [on the blog](https://mansfield-devine.com/speculatrix/category/projects/iot-thermometer/).

This sensor is designed to communicate with a REST API on my intranet server via HTTP, so you'll need to set that up yourself, or change the code to suit whatever arrangements you have.

Also, because I use a number of custom fonts with the TFT_eSPI library, don't be surprised if this doesn't run right out of the gate. You may need to do considerable tweaking. I'm afraid you're on your own with that.
