Copy this folder to your Arduino libraries folder. Alternatively, copy the HomeWifi.h file up into the main sketch folder.

Edit the settings in the HomeWifi.h file to match your wifi network.

If you have only one AP, put the same SSID for both the main and alt APs.

If you put this in the libraries folder you can use it from other projects that need to connect to the same wifi AP.
