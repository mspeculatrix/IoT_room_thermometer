/* Wifi credentials
	
	Edit this file to match your wifi environment.
	
	Put as many SSIDs as you want in the ssid array (it can contain
	just one, if that's all you have). This assumes the password is
	the same for all access points.

	Once you've made the edits, rename (or 'save as...') this file
	with the filename: wifi-credentials.h in the same directory as
	the main sketch.
