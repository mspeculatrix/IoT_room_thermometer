The files here need to be copied to the relevant locations in the TFT_eSPI folder in your Arduino libraries folder.

In some cases, the files here will overwrite the library's default files (you might want to rename the originals first, so that you have them as a backup.)

**Do NOT simply replace the TFT_eSPI folder with this folder.** This folder contains only the modified or additional files, not the main library files.

If you update the TFT_eSPI library, you will lose these files. Keep copies of them in a safe place so that you can re-copy them over after each update.
